# HCAHPS Patient Satisfaction Visualization
HCAHPS = Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems

It is a patient satisfaction survey that most hospitals are required to submit to The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 

The survey asks patients questions like:

- Was the hospital always quiet and clean at night?
- Did the nurses and doctors treat you with respect?
- Did you receive call button help as soon as possible?
- Did you understand your discharge instructions?

Patients are asked to rate how often these things happened. **Answers include: "Never", "Sometimes", “Usually” or "Always".** 

The "Always" wording is what the hospital aims for, and is called a ***Top Box*** ***score***. 

The percentage of patients that answered *Top Box* for a question is collected from HCAHPS and submitted to CMS to assess how often that hospital provided excellent care.

In this project, I prepare the data using SQL and visualize it with a Tableau Dashboard. The dashboard classifies hospitals by state and size and compares each hospital on key HCAHPS metrics (e.g. how often a hospital achieved a _Top Box_ score for a question) with other hospitals of its 'cohort'.
